- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @kaeaddaar. My name is Clifford MacKay
- I like to write integrations. For Example: Lets access the product data from a POS system like System Five and sync it with online software like Shopify, Dakis, or WebJaguar
- I want to migrate these integrations to the cloud and enhance the overall experience through reporting, notifications, and more. 
- Even though I've programmed in dozens of languages, I prefer to write in C#.
- I'm looking forward to building the web ui for my portal in blazor, and building mobile apps using .Net MAUI.
